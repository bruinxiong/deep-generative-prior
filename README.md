### Demos

DGP exploits the image prior of an off-the-shelf GAN for various image restoration and manipulation.

**Image restoration**:

**Image manipulation**:

A **learned prior** helps **internal learning**:

### Requirements

* python>=3.6
* pytorch>=1.0.1
* others

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Get Started

Before start, please download the pretrained BigGAN at [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1buQ2BtbnUhkh4PEPXOgdPuVo2iRK7gvI?usp=sharing) or [Baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10GKkWt7kSClvhnEGQU4ckA) (password: uqtw), and put them to `pretrained` folder.

Example1: run image colorization example:
    
    sh experiments/examples/run_colorization.sh   

The results will be saved in `experiments/examples/images` and `experiments/examples/image_sheet`.

Example2: process images with an image list:
    
    sh experiments/examples/run_inpainting_list.sh   

Example3: evaluate on 1k ImageNet validation images via distributed training based on [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/):

    # need to specifiy the root path of imagenet validate set in --root_dir
    sh experiments/imagenet1k_128/colorization/train_slurm.sh   

Note:  
\- BigGAN needs a class condition as input. If no class condition is provided, it would be chosen from a set of random samples.  
\- The hyperparameters provided may not be optimal, feel free to tune them.
